Overview

*Project Purpose*
This 3D environment will be a part of an interactive animated series called “Alien Counter
Encounters.” In this experience, the player travels around the universe, encountering aliens of
different cultures at various counters. In this scene, the user can interact with a four-armed alien
clerk at a video game shop, where they will be able to wander the aisles, and browse through
video games of a far-off galaxy.
